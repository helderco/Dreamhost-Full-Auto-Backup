Dreamhost Full Auto Backup (DEPRECATED)
=======================================

You can read more from Dreamhost's Personal Backpus at <http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Personal_Backup>


Deprecation notice
------------------

This script is now **obsolete**. Dreamhost decided, for security reasons, not to provide passwords through the API anymore. I was depending on that to fully automate backups without the user having to do anything when adding databases and users to his/her account. So I decided to re-write this from scratch but with Python, in another effort to automate as much as possible the backup of mysql databases and user files in Dreamhost.

New: https://github.com/helderco/dh-auto-backup


Introduction
------------

I needed a simple script to backup all my mysql databases and users on my dreamhost account. 

With this solution I don't need to store here all my sensitive login for mysqldump, nor do I need to 
set up ssh public keys for passwordless connections, whenever I add a new user (or remove!).

I just have a passwordless ssh login set up from my main account to the backup account, and run the 
script from there as a cronjob.

The API key must be provided as an argument to the script. This is also to prevent storing sensitive 
data on the file.

I use PHP's SimpleXMLElement class to easily get my data from the API. That's where all the data 
necessary (including passwords), comes from. I also use an Expect script to remotely ssh into the 
other user accounts and rsync them from there.

So I don't need to do anything when I create/delete databases/users. This is the purpose of a fully 
automated backup system. The more automated the better. Very little configuration is needed.


Installation
------------

It's very simple:

*   Activate your dreamhost [backups user account](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Personal_Backup);
*   Set up [passwordless login](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Ssh#Passwordless_Login) between your 
    main account and the backups server;
*   Create an [API](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Api) key with the following functions: 
    [user-list_users](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Api#user-list_users), 
    [mysql-list_dbs](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Api#mysql-list_dbs), 
    [mysql-list_users](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Api#mysql-list_users);
*   Create a folder for the mysql dumps;
*   Download the script and put it anywhere you want;
*   Create a [cronjon](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Goodies_Control_Panel#Cron_Jobs) to run daily.


Execution
---------

Note that you can give the script any name you want. Also, make sure you provide a path to a PHP5 version. 

You can check with:

`$ php -v`

And to find the location:

`$ which php`

If this [returns what you need](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Enabling_the_use_of_PHP5_by_default_in_the_shell) 
you don't have to provide the full path bellow, unless you're doing it from the panel's 
[cronjobs](https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=goodies.cron).

At this time, on dreamhost, the path to PHP5 is

`/usr/local/php5/bin/php`


### Method 1 ###

`$ /path/to/php -q path/to/script api_key`


### Method 2 ###

[Add this](http://www.php-cli.com/php-cli-tutorial.shtml#first) to the beginning of the file

`#!/path/to/php -q`

...then make it executable with

`$ chmod u+x path/to/script`

...and run it as

`$ path/to/script api_key`


Contribute
----------

I'm interested in improvements, so be free to contribute.

Suggestions: 

*   Make this simpler; 
*   Create local mysql backup folder if it doesn't exist;
*   Improve [Expect](http://expect.nist.gov/) script to be smarter.
